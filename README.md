# React Portfolio
The asignment was to remake my portfolio using React and styled components. I was supposed to use my own json file to fecth data and display my featured projects. I was following a given design.
## The problem
For this project I made a structure and split the site up in 9 components. I decided what could be used as global styles and then worked with styled components.
If I had more time I would spend more time planning the styling and structure to make the code neater and the styling more consistent.
